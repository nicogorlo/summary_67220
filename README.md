## Notes

- Use at your own risk, I give no guarantees that the notes are correct or complete.
- The notes are written in LaTeX with very minimal formatting and small font to fit as much as possible on a single page.
- There is a lot of very basic information included to prevent the worst cases of test anxiety.

I hope you find these notes helpful. Good luck with your exam!
